DataSafe Locker
A secure offline password vault built with modern cryptography. DataSafe Locker encrypts and stores sensitive information using AES-256-GCM and PBKDF2 — ensuring your passwords never leave your device and remain protected even without internet access.

Features:
AES-256-GCM encryption
PBKDF2 key-derivation (master password-based security)
Salt & IV generation for each encryption call
Secure encrypted LocalStorage vault
Add, Edit, View, Delete entries
Built-in Encrypt / Decrypt panel
Dark & Light Theme
Pure client-side security — no server, no data sharing

How It Works:
Step	Process
1	User creates master password
2	PBKDF2 generates AES-256 key
3	Password entries are encrypted with random IV
4	Encrypted values saved to LocalStorage
5	Decryption only happens locally after login

Security Stack:
AES-256-GCM	Modern, authenticated encryption
PBKDF2-SHA256	Strengthens master password
Random Salt	Prevents rainbow attacks
Random IV per record	Ensures unique encryption
Web Crypto API	Native browser crypto engine

Project Structure:
DataSafe Locker
 ┣ index.html       
 ┣ style.css        
 ┣ vault.js         
 ┗ README.md

How to Run:
No installation required.
Just open index.html in any modern browser.
Or deploy with GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel:
Upload the three files: index.html, style.css, vault.js

Tech Used:
Category	Tech
Language	JavaScript
Crypto	Web Crypto API (AES-256-GCM + PBKDF2)
Storage	Encrypted LocalStorage
Front-End	HTML, CSS, Custom UI

Why Offline Vault?
Most online password managers sync to cloud — creating breach risk.
This vault runs completely local-only:
No cloud syncing
No external servers
No tracking
Full user control of encryption keys

Future Enhancements:
Desktop App (Electron)
Optional secure sync (encrypted cloud backup)
Password generator
Autofill browser extension
Biometric unlock (if supported)
